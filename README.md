# Kenya-Counties-SubCounties-and-Wards
A JSON-formatted file containing information on Kenya's administrative units, including counties, sub-counties (constituencies), and wards. The data is organized according to the boundaries defined by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). This dataset provides a detailed overview of the hierarchical administrative divisions within Kenya, from the 47 counties down to their respective sub-counties and wards. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding the geographic and administrative layout of Kenya, useful for governance, planning, electoral processes, and data analysis.

The dataset is structured in a nested format, where each county is represented as a top-level key, containing sub-keys for each sub-county, and within each sub-county, a list of wards. This hierarchical organization facilitates easy navigation and retrieval of information for various applications, such as regional planning, development projects, policy-making, demographic studies, and electoral management. The use of standard JSON format ensures compatibility with a wide range of programming languages and data processing tools, making it a versatile and essential dataset for anyone working with geographic or administrative data in Kenya.
